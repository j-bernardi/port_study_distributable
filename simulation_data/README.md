Data from the scripts (eg tbr values against model, and surface area calculations against model and TBR) goes in here.

NOTE: 
	SA_data_test.txt is testing changing the cut-off to see effect on area (see get_surface_area.py for more info).
	Also does repeat runs to verify.
Combined data was final data used in the study
